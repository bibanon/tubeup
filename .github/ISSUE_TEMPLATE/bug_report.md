**Checklist**

Carefully read and work through this check list in order to prevent the most common mistakes and misuse of tubeup:
- First of, make sure you are using the latest version of tubeup. Issues with outdated version will be REJECTED.
- Make sure that all provided video/audio/playlist URLs (if any) are alive and playable in a browser.
- Make sure that all URLs and arguments with special characters are properly quoted or escaped.
- Search the Github repo issues for similar issues: https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup/issues. Please DO NOT post duplicates.
- Finally, put x into all relevant boxes (like this [x])

- [ ] I have fully updated tubeup, youtube-dl and internetarchive along with their associated dependencies.

- [ ] I've checked that all URLs and arguments with special characters are properly quoted or escaped
- [ ] I've searched the issues for similar bug reports including closed ones
- [ ] I am not submitting a bug report about S3 timeouts (we have no control over Internet Archive outages or per-user throttling)

- [ ] I have included the full un-redacted URL, properly indented full terminal terminal output from the line where the command was run to where I was returned to command prompt, and am not trying to obscure item identifiers or URLs used in the creation of the bug (we need this to recreate the bug or investigate what happened).
